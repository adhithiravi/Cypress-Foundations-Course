Course link: [Optimizing and Deploying Applications in Next.js 15](https://www.pluralsight.com/library/courses/optimizing-deploying-applications-next-js-15/table-of-contents)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Course Objectives

Performance issues and inefficient deployment processes can lead to poor user experiences and slow application load times, especially in complex web applications. In this course, Optimizing and Deploying Applications in Next.js 15, you’ll learn how to improve the performance and deployment efficiency of your Next.js applications. 

First, you’ll explore how to optimize common UI components, such as images, links, and scripts, using built-in Next.js features. Next, you’ll discover advanced techniques for optimizing images and fonts to further enhance loading times and user experience. Finally, you’ll learn how to implement effective performance optimization strategies, such as code splitting, lazy loading, and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), as well as deploying applications efficiently with Vercel and continuous deployment pipelines. 

When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of Next.js performance optimization and deployment needed to create fast, scalable, and easily deployable applications.
